# KNOWLEDGE MANAGEMENT SYSTEM
A knowledge management system is any kind of IT system that stores and retrieves knowledge to improve understanding, collaboration, and process alignment. Knowledge management systems can exist within organizations or teams, but they can also be used to center your knowledge base for users.


This is my Computer Science Software Enginering Project[So code is not so good expecially HTML AND CSS PART].  
This application is a extension for our College Assignment Submission Portal. So this is a site where teachers are able to assign assignments to students by filling a form and assigning one of the language(C,C++,JAVA,Python). Students need to write code and input in a form. If the code is compiled and run. Assignment will be submitted otherwise it will show ERROR.    
Compilation is done by HackerRank API.  
Steps:- 
* Import student.sql to student database in phpmyAdmin  
* Login using Teacher USERNAME:-111111 Paassword:-hardpassword
* Login using Student USERNAME:-151600 Password:-151600

# Future Scope
More features can be added to the system, such as :
   * Student can be notified or alerted through SMS or email about new assighnments.
   * Hosting Application on secure cloud network.
   * Extending to other features like attendance , notice publishing , event notifications,etc. 
   * Lectures Notes , Videos and previous year paper can be shaired through the interface.
   * Multiple colleges can employ this to evaluate the students on university level.
